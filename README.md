This repository provides an **isolated development environment template** designed to enable seamless **C++, Python(uv), and ROS 1 / ROS 2** development without polluting your host system. Start developing immediately across any project without complex configurations.

## 💡 Core Values

- **Zero-Pollution Isolation**: Only install Docker on your host machine. All libraries and dependencies are entirely managed by lightweight containers to prevent system conflicts.
- **Hardware Agnostic**: Auto-detects NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD GPUs. Provides instant hardware acceleration on both **X11 and modern Wayland environments**.
- **Production Ready**: Utilizes a **Bake & Switch** strategy to build deployment-ready production images directly from your development environment artifacts, complete with built-in **automatic dependency verification (Sanity Check)**.
- **Unified Workspace**: Every project follows an identical directory structure (`src`, `build`, `install`), drastically improving team collaboration and long-term maintainability.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Intelligent Diagnostic Engine**: Running `make status` identifies the host's GPU architecture, CPU architecture (AMD64/ARM64), display protocols, and **Wayland socket paths** to automatically orchestrate the optimal runtime environment.
- **Unified Workspace (Everything is a Package)**: All projects (C++, Python, ROS) adhere to the standard **`src/` (Source), `build/` (Build), and `install/` (Artifacts)** structure, maximizing consistency between development and deployment workflows.
- **Perfect Reproducibility via APT Snapshots**: Guarantees 100% reproducibility by pinning package versions at a specific point in time using `APT_SNAPSHOT_DATE`. By setting a UTC date (obtained via `date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ`) in your `.env` file, the environment is permanently frozen at that exact moment.
- **Runtime Dependency Guardian (Sanity Check)**: When building deployment images, it automatically inspects executables and libraries for missing dependencies using `ldd`, completely preventing 'Shared library not found' errors at runtime.
- **Ultra-lightweight & Secure Deployments (Bake & Switch)**: Deployment images exclude source code and only retain **production artifacts** from the `install/` directory, ensuring maximum security and runtime efficiency.
- **Native Multi-Arch Support**: Supports both Intel PCs and ARM-based (Jetson, Apple Silicon) environments seamlessly through a single Dockerfile.
- **Consistent Permission System (Root Unity)**: Uses the `root` user in both development and deployment environments to prevent tricky permission conflicts when mounting host volumes.
- **Zero-Pollution Cleanup (Sudo-Free Architecture)**: Spawns an ultra-lightweight disposable container to perform deletion tasks without requiring `sudo` privileges when cleaning host storage (`make clean`). The container and image are automatically removed immediately after the task, leaving no trace on your local environment.
- **CI/CD Robustness**: Includes a `FORCE=1` flag that bypasses interactive prompts, combined with auto-detection for the platform's `CI=true` environment variable, ensuring flawless execution without stalling in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

## 🏗 Multi-stage Docker Architecture

This template utilizes a granular container build pipeline to maximize speed and cache efficiency.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Base OS] --> B[dev-base-tools <br/> Utilities/Build/GUI]
    B --> C[dev-core <br/> Python & Core Config]
    C --> D[dev <br/> Dev Targets]
    C --> E[builder <br/> Bake]
    E --> F[runtime <br/> Lightweight Prod]
```

---

## 🚀 Standard Workspace Layout

Every project adheres to this layout, regardless of the underlying language or framework.

- **`src/`**: All source code and build configurations (CMakeLists.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- **`build/`**: Temporary build space utilized by compilers and build systems.
- **`install/`**: The **deployment artifacts** directory where final executables, libraries, and Python virtual environments (`.venv`) are stored.
  - *Note: The Python virtual environment is intentionally placed inside `install/` so it can be executed independently without the source code upon deployment. For IDE compatibility, a `.venv` symlink is automatically created in the project root.*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Copy Template and Initialize Project

Create an isolated new project folder on your host machine and inject the template files (Or use the **Use this template** button on GitHub).

```bash
# Copy template
mkdir -p /path/to/my_new_project
cp -r /path/to/project_template/* /path/to/my_new_project/
cp -r /path/to/project_template/.[!.]* /path/to/my_new_project/

cd /path/to/my_new_project
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables (Core ⭐️)

Run `make setup` to generate the `.env` file, which is used to configure your isolated project environment.

```bash
make setup
nano .env
```

Within the `.env` file, **select a matching `BASE_IMAGE` and `ROS_DISTRO` pair** and modify the following values:

```ini
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=my_new_project         # Unique Docker resource identifier (Must be changed)

# WORKSPACE_PATH=/path/to/my_new_project    # Absolute project path (Optional, Default: current directory)

# ROS 2 (Default)
BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:22.04
ROS_DISTRO=humble

# ROS 1 (For legacy systems)
# BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:20.04
# ROS_DISTRO=noetic
```

### 3. SSH Host Key Security Configuration (Optional)

To enable seamless communication with Git servers from inside the Docker container, ensure your host's private key permissions correspond correctly.

```bash
# Execute on the Host PC
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # or id_ed25519
```

### 4. Start Development Environment and Check Status

```bash
make status         # Auto-detect current project configuration, GPU, Architecture, and Toolkit
make build-ros      # Build ROS image (Automatic Multi-Arch support)
make ros            # Start and enter the ROS container (Auto-detects GPU)
# OR
make dev            # Start pure C++/Python container (Auto-detects GPU)
```

## 💻 Running the Environment and GPU Modes

The system automatically selects the optimal hardware mode for your workstation.

| Environment | Run Command (Auto GPU Detect) | Restart | Enter Shell (Default Window) | Open New Window (GUI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROS Env** | **`make ros`** | **`make ros-restart`** | **`make ros-shell`** | **`make ros-term`** |
| **Pure Dev** | **`make dev`** | **`make dev-restart`** | **`make dev-shell`** | **`make dev-term`** |

> **Tip:** You can use `make status` to verify if the current system accurately recognizes an NVIDIA GPU and the Container Toolkit, and to confirm the active architecture (AMD64/ARM64).

## 🛠 In-Container Development Workflow

Experience a consistent UX across any project using standard aliases and shortcuts after connecting.

### 🏁 First Setup & Initialization Scenario

If you've entered the container shell for the first time, perform the following initialization. Since development environments are orchestrated on-demand, these initial setup steps are required.

```bash
# 1. 🐍 Create Python virtual environment and download dependencies
mkenv             # Create /workspace/install/.venv and root symlink
uvs               # (Recommended) Lightning-fast dependency installation via pyproject.toml (uv sync)
# uvp -r dependencies/requirements.txt  # (Alternative) For standard pip requirements

# 2. 📦 Download ROS and C++ Third-party Dependencies
sync_deps         # Clone dependencies.repos and auto-install rosdep system packages

# 3. 🔨 Orchestrate Source Code Build
cb                # ROS: Execute colcon build (RelWithDebInfo default)
# mbuild          # Pure C++: Execute standard cmake & make
```

> 💡 **Tip (Non-interactive Force Execution and CI Mode)**
> To fundamentally prevent data loss, the `clean` series commands require deletion consent (`[Y/N]`) by default.
> To bypass this restriction dynamically or inject it into an automated shell script, append the `FORCE=1` argument like **`make clean FORCE=1`**.
> (※ On automation platforms like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, the `CI=true` environment variable is automatically detected, bypassing redundant prompts without requiring script modification!)

## 🚀 Production Deployment Workflow

The production environment operates completely without source code, leveraging the deterministic **Bake & Switch** strategy.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Source Code] -->|make build-ros-prod| B(Builder Image)
    B -->|Compile & Install| C{install/ Artifacts}
    C -->|Copy| D(Runtime Image)
    D -->|make ros-prod| E[Production Service]
```

### ⚠️ Pre-Deployment Recommendations (Data Hygiene)

Before baking the production image, executing **`make clean`** is strictly recommended.

**Recommended Build Sequence:**

1. **`make clean`**: Completely obliterates any existing build residues and flushes isolated volume data.

2. **`make build-ros-prod`**: Builds (Bakes) the pristine deployment image starting from a clean state.

- **Reason:** When using bind mounts, this strictly isolates and prevents stale files or outdated build artifacts left on the host from leaking into the deployment image.

### 1. Features of the Deployment Image (`Dockerfile.prod`)

- **Explicit Source Code Exclusion**: Only the `install/` artifacts generated strictly during the compilation stage (Builder) are cleanly replicated into the final runtime image.
- **Automatic Dependency Verification (Sanity Check)**: Assures absolute runtime stability by executing an `ldd` scan during the build to verify all essential shared libraries are structurally embedded.
- **Maximized Determinism**: Maintains perfect environmental parity and isolation using APT snapshots and `uv sync --frozen`.

### 2. Deployment Service Control Commands (Auto GPU Detection)

| Category | Execute Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROS Deployment** | **`make ros-prod`** | Spawns a dedicated service based on optimized ROS artifacts |
| **Pure Deployment** | **`make dev-prod`** | Spawns a lightweight service strictly for C++/Python artifacts |
| **Extract Image** | **`make save-ros`** / **`save-dev`** | Wraps the deployment image as an isolated compressed archive (`.tar.gz`) |
| **Restore Image** | **`make load-ros`** / **`load-dev`** | Ingests an image from an isolated compressed archive back into the registry |

### 3. Offline Deployment Guide

When migrating a framework to an isolated edge target server restricted natively from the network, physically transfer the extracted Docker image archive.

```bash
# 1. Build the deployment image (Bake)
make build-ros-prod  # Or make build-dev-prod

# 2. Extract the physical image (Makefile-based automation)
make save-ros        # Wraps {project}-ros-{distro}.tar.gz in the project root upon success

# 3. Transmit the physical elements safely (Required variables: .tar.gz, .env, docker-compose.prod.yml, Makefile)
# Place the structurally sound .tar.gz file in the target server's physical root directory.

# 4. Ingest and spawn inside the isolated target server
make load-ros        # Automatically isolates and ingests the archive file
make ros-prod        # Spin up the target service natively
```

## 📡 Remote Visualization Guide for Production Environments (Prod)

The finalized production environment inherently executes in a strict **Headless mode** for maximum efficiency. Strategically isolate visualization by utilizing your **networked Dev environment laptop**.

- **ROS 2**: Match the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` locally inside the `.env` of both the robot (Prod) and laptop (Dev), then launch `rviz2` on your laptop.
- **ROS 1**: Assign the `ROS_MASTER_URI` natively inside the `.env` to the isolated robot's IP scheme.
- **General Dev**: It is universally recommended to push telemetry securely from the server via a modern FastAPI web dashboard or WebSockets locally to the laptop's browser.

## 📦 External Dependency Management Strategy (SSOT Determinism)

This template adheres to a clear core principle for managing dependencies:

- **Development Environment (Dev)**: Python dependencies and ROS packages (excluding system APT packages) are **never installed automatically**. For optimal flexibility, you must mount the source code directory (`src/`) and install dependencies **On-Demand (manually)** via shortcuts (`mkenv`, `sync_deps`) from your active shell.
- **Production Deployment Environment (Prod)**: To guarantee deployment stability, all Python packages and ROS/C++ dependencies are **100% baked-in** to the image without requiring any manual intervention during the Docker build sequence.

Under this separation principle, we provide systematic dependency management methods for each ecosystem below.

### 1. Python Layer (`uv` + `pyproject.toml`)

Python dependencies are deterministically managed using the lightning-fast `uv` package manager.

- **Multiple Formats & Conflict Prevention**: The template exclusively relies on ultra-fast `uv` as its core engine. Managing versions via `pyproject.toml` (`uv sync`) is highly recommended, while legacy `requirements.txt` (`uv pip`) approaches are also supported. To prevent dependency conflicts natively, if both files exist together, only the `pyproject.toml` process will be executed (Mutual Exclusion).
- **External Packages and Git Integration**: When pulling external sources, specifying a target branch or commit directly via `[tool.uv.sources]` inside `pyproject.toml` is the strongly recommended approach.
- **Hardware Acceleration Separation (GPU/CPU)**: Heavy deep learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch) should be cleanly separated using `optional-dependencies`.

  ```toml
  # pyproject.toml structural isolation strategy
  [project.optional-dependencies]
  cpu = ["torch==2.9.1"]
  gpu = ["torch==2.9.1"]

  [tool.uv.sources]
  torch = [
      { index = "pytorch-cpu", extra = "cpu" },
      { index = "pytorch-cu128", extra = "gpu" },
  ]
  ```

  Assigning `UV_SYNC_FLAGS="--extra gpu"` in your `.env` file ensures the template automatically installs the correct, optimized packages during Docker build and setup.

### 2. C++ & ROS Layer (`CMake` + `dependencies.repos`)

For C++ and ROS environments, you can manage dependencies through two primary methods:

- **`FetchDependencies.cmake` (Build-time Linking)**: Use this to instantly download specific libraries from GitHub during the `CMakeLists.txt` build time for static/dynamic linking. You can directly edit this file to freely add required C++ dependencies like `nlohmann_json` or `spdlog`.
- **`dependencies.repos` (Source-level Sync)**: Useful for pulling uncompiled source code of external libraries that you need to modify alongside your own project (Editable mode).
  - **Auto Sync**: Define targets in `dependencies/dependencies.repos` to automatically clone them into the `src/thirdparty` directory upon container startup (`make dev` or `make ros`).
  - **Overlay Structure**: Files placed inside the `dependencies/overlay/` directory will safely overwrite the cloned source targets after synchronization completes.

### 3. Build Speed and Dependency Optimization (`config/colcon.meta`)

Building massive external C++/ROS libraries (Eigen3, GTSAM, Librealsense2, etc.) directly from source can result in excessively long build times due to test compilation, or cause runtime conflicts (e.g. Eigen ODR Violation).

- The built-in `config/colcon.meta` file solves this by automatically injecting custom CMake options into specific packages during a `colcon build`.
- **Core Examples**: The default configurations completely disable unnecessary test compilations (`BUILD_TESTING=OFF`) to speed up builds, and enforce the use of system libraries (`GTSAM_USE_SYSTEM_EIGEN=ON`) to prevent memory conflicts.
- **Customization (ROS)**: You can easily add package names and their custom CMake arguments to this file to orchestrate the entire workspace compile process.
- **Customization (C++)**: For pure C++ builds without `colcon`, utilize the `CMAKE_EXTRA_ARGS` variable in `.env`.
  - For a few options: Pass them directly, e.g., `CMAKE_EXTRA_ARGS="-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DGTSAM_USE_SYSTEM_EIGEN=ON"`.
  - For many options: Write them to a file (e.g., `config/cmake_cache.cmake` with `set(BUILD_TESTING OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)`) and inject the file via `CMAKE_EXTRA_ARGS="-C /workspace/config/cmake_cache.cmake"`.

### 4. System Layer (APT Packages)

- **Method**: Specify any required OS-level Linux packages in `dependencies/apt.txt` (General) or `dependencies/apt_ros.txt` (ROS-specific).
- Packages that must also be present in the final deployment image should have a `# runtime` comment at the end of the line. These will be efficiently installed utilizing BuildKit cache during image generation.

---

## ⚠️ Security and Architectural Constraints (Security Notes)

1. **`root` Privilege Parity**: Both development and deployment containers operate as the `root` user. This resolves file ownership issues of mounted host volumes and elevates device accessibility.
2. **`privileged: true`**: To freely utilize devices like sensors, USBs, and CAN communications during ROS development, the development container runs in privileged mode.
3. **`network_mode: host`**: Directly uses the host network for optimal DDS communication performance in ROS. To prevent interference across multiple projects, configure a unique `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` in `.env`.
